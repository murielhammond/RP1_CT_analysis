    "In this code, PDB files from the PED database (url : https://proteinensemble.org/) are downloaded using API. An excel list with the PED entry of only experimentally obtained proteins isused to filter the downloads. The files are downloaded as targs using the API, after these are converted to PDB files. After, the proteins that are not single chain topologies and contain more than 200 frames are filtered out. Consequently, the hydrogen atoms are removed and residues are renumbered and only the lines not starting with 'ATOM' are removed.\n",
